# Space Missions
This is an exploratory analysis on space missions embarked on by different countries between 1957 and 2022. During this project, my goal was to provide answers to the following questions and to learn more about space missions and the progress of human's journey to space so far.

1. How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?

2. Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way? 

3. Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?

Added to this repositoray is .pptx file containing a comprehesive report on how I went about this project; from data sourcing to data wrangling with Excel and to Tableau vizualization
