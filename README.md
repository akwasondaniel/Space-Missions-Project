# Space Missions
An exploratory analysis on space missions embarked on by different countries between 1957 and 2022

I carried out an exploratory #data #analysis on Space missions between 1957 and 2022 to see if I can find answers to the following questions

1. How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?

2. Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way? 

3. Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?

Interestingly, my finding were no where close to my expectations. This #experience further consolidates my belief to strongly rely on #data driven decisions.
